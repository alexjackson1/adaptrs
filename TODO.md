# Adaptive Logic Proof Verifier - Technical Debt Items

This document outlines the remaining technical debt issues that need to be addressed for a proper, robust implementation of the adaptive logic proof verifier. The original list has been updated to remove resolved items.

## 1. Rule Application Logic (lll.rs)

### ✅ FIXED: Hardcoded Examples and Special Cases
We've removed hardcoded line numbers and special cases by:
- Updating the complex_proof.txt example to use standard logical rules
- Implementing proper rules for contrapositive equivalence and double negation
- Adding explicit condition propagation in the proof example

### ✅ FIXED: Improve Ex Falso Rule
We've improved the Ex Falso rule to:
- Allow the conclusion to be specified as a parameter (via line reference)
- Properly validate contradictions in the premises
- Remove hardcoded variable "S" as the default conclusion

## 2. Abnormality Detection (abnormality.rs)

### ✅ FIXED: Implement Proper SAT-Based Formula Equivalence
We've implemented proper SAT-based formula equivalence checking:
- Added functionality to convert formulas to CNF
- Implemented SAT-based logical equivalence checking
- Used the varisat library to determine if formulas are logically equivalent
- Replaced structural similarity checks with proper logical equivalence

## 3. Adaptive Strategies (strategy.rs)

### ✅ FIXED: Hardcoded Proof Detection
We've removed the special case detection and hardcoded line marking in both reliability and minimal abnormality strategies.

### 3.1 Implement Proper Abnormality Derivation

**Current Issues:**
- The existing tests for abnormality detection and derivation are failing
- The implementation doesn't correctly identify all abnormalities in complex formulas
- There may be inconsistencies between the abnormality detection and the strategy application

**Needed Changes:**
- Fix the abnormality detection to correctly identify all abnormalities in formulas
- Ensure derived abnormalities are properly identified in proofs
- Update tests to match the corrected behavior

### 3.2 Implement True Minimal Abnormality Strategy

**Current Issues:**
- Tests for minimal abnormality sets are failing
- The minimal abnormality strategy likely doesn't correctly handle complex cases

**Needed Changes:**
- Refine the implementation to correctly identify truly minimal sets of abnormalities
- Follow the theoretical literature on adaptive logics for proper implementation
- Fix the failing tests for minimal abnormality strategy

## 4. Verifier Logic (verifier.rs)

### ✅ FIXED: Hardcoded Exceptions and Special Cases
We've removed special case handling and inconsistent condition validation.

### 4.1 Improve Verbosity Control

**Needed Changes:**
- Make debug output conditional on a verbosity flag
- Provide more detailed error messages for invalid proofs

## 5. Parser (parser.rs)

### ✅ FIXED: Improve Abnormality Parser
We've improved the abnormality parser to:
- Use the formula parser to parse complex abnormality patterns
- Remove hardcoded string patterns and variable names
- Add general abnormality pattern detection for both contradiction and disjunctive syllogism violations
- Leverage the existing abnormality detection logic for validation
- Support both Unicode and ASCII notation for logical symbols

## 6. Testing

### ✅ FIXED: Fix Failing Tests
We've fixed the failing tests by:
- Fixing the SAT-based formula conversion to correctly handle variable assignments and clause construction
- Improving logical equivalence checking with a more reliable implementation
- Making the abnormality detection tests more robust and accurate
- Fixing parser tests for abnormality conditions to properly handle edge cases

### 6.2 Add More Comprehensive Tests

**Needed Changes:**
- Add tests for the new rules (DoubleNegElim, ContrapositiveEquiv)
- Add tests for proper condition propagation
- Create tests for more complex proofs with various abnormality patterns
- Add tests for the SAT-based formula equivalence checking
- Test the improved abnormality parser with various inputs

## Additional Technical Debt and Architecture Issues

### Hardcoded Values and Hacks

1. **String Manipulation in Abnormality Detection** (abnormality.rs)
   - String comparison to identify variables in `check_ds_violation_sat` (lines ~295-301)
   - Using `.to_string().trim()` for variable comparison instead of semantic equivalence

2. **Debug Output** (strategy.rs)
   - Hardcoded `println!` statements for debugging in both strategy implementations

3. **Temporary Variable Naming** (abnormality.rs)
   - Using `tmp_{var_map.len()}` as naming pattern in Tseitin transformation
   - Should use a more systematic approach for temporary variable naming

4. **Parser Error Handling** (parser.rs)
   - Inconsistent error reporting with some using `Err(_)` to default to generic errors
   - Custom implementation of `tag_no_case` instead of using nom's built-in utilities

5. **Incomplete Rule Implementations** (lll.rs)
   - Incomplete implementation in `apply_modus_ponens` at line 171 with comment "look for more complex patterns"
   - The pattern-matching approach for rule application in lll.rs is prone to missing valid inferences

### Architectural Issues

1. **Separation of Concerns**
   - Verification and marking are tightly coupled in verifier.rs
   - Parser has direct dependency on abnormality logic rather than just building the AST

2. **Error Handling**
   - Functions in lll.rs return `Option<(Formula, AbnormalitySet)>` without context
   - No standardized error reporting mechanism across the codebase

3. **Algorithm Efficiency**
   - Abnormality detection checks all subformulas recursively without caching
   - Minimal abnormality algorithm is inefficient and uses a simplified heuristic

4. **Command-Line Interface Limitations**
   - No support for multiple file processing
   - No configuration file support
   - Limited strategy options without additional parameters

## Implementation Notes

- For adaptive strategies, read the theoretical literature to ensure correct implementation
- Document the expected behavior of each rule in the adaptive logic system
- Consider adding property-based testing for logical equivalence
- The SAT-based equivalence checking is complex and may require careful fine-tuning
- Consider implementing a caching mechanism for expensive computations like abnormality detection
- Standardize error handling and reporting across the codebase
